******GRAPHICS******
-Add graphics to tiles?(pixel art)
-Add animations to all tiles(probably not, would cause lag)
-images for achievements?(simple, small)
square shaped? maybe circle? or rounded square(mixture)
-image of gameplay on title screen(maybe made with pixel art? Might be difficult, would look awesome)
-images of different good/bad events? Probably not

******SOUNDS******
-Add sounds for the buttons presses on menu
-Add achievement sounds
-Add general bad event/good event sound(s)
maybe specific ones? (etc. burning sound effect for FIRE! event) might not work for things like OH NO(virus) event
-Different sounds for different buttons(End Year button might have a different sound than Market button)
-louder, maybe epic music for title screen and achievements?

******GAMEPLAY******
-more achievements
-secret achievements?
-improve mountain generation?
-might be cool to have more buildings that have unique shapes so that using land efficiently is harder
-rotatable buildings? Might be hard to code (already tried, didn't work so well)
-bad event: insula collapse(lose insula, -20% population, +10 resources[wreckage])
